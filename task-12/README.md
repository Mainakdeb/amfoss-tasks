## Task 12:
  
  ### Hurdles Faced:
  
  * The code was in Python2, converting it to Python3 was a pain.
  * Figuring out the xor() function took time.
  * I made reverse functions, but I was using them in the wrong order.
  
  ### Things I learned:
  
  * Learnt about the XOR gate.
  * Discovered that the xor() and the unxor() function are same, example => string = xor(xor(string)).
  * Learnt about hex(), ord() function.
  * Reversing is fun.
