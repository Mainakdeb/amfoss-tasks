## Task 13:
  
  ### Hurdles Faced:
  
  * Handling the corner cases were a bit tricky.
  * Time limit was a big factor.
  * The test cases were hidden, which further increased the difficulty.
  
  ### Things I learned:
  
  * Found an interesting pattern, which aided the performance in the last problem.
  * Project Euler forced me to optimse code (avoid dots, avoid unnecessary for loops) for performance, which I rarely       do.
