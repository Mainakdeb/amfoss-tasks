## Task 2:
  
  ### Hurdles Faced:
  
  * Diagonal difference was more difficult than I thought.
  * The corner cases in the Time_converion problem were a bit tricky.
  * Making sense out of the question statement of the Next_round problem took some time.
  
  ### Things I learned:
  
  * Brushed up basic problem solving skills
  
***

## Task 3:
  
  ### Hurdles Faced:
  
  * Zero prior experience with Ruby-lang.
  * Extracting the search results from the downloaded file.
  * Formatting the output for better readability.
  
  ### Things I learned:
  
  * Reading the official documentation helps a lot.
  * Handling alien languages using Google.
***

## Task 5:
  
  ### Hurdles Faced:
  
  * Didn't even know that GraphQL existed.
  * Had to learn parts of HTML from scratch, w3schools saved me.
  * Making the right query.
  
  ### Things I learned:
  
  * GraphQL is better than REST API, but the learning curve is steep.
***
## Task 6:
  
  ### Hurdles Faced:
  
  * Had no idea how to use an API in GO-Lang 
  * Took some time to get used to the syntax.
  * Couldn't figure out how to write the data in a text file

  ### Things I learned:
  
  * Basics of Go-Lang.
  * Learned a weird trick to bypass the annoying “declared and not used” error.
***
## Task 7:
  
  ### Hurdles Faced:
  
  * Didn't know what RegEx was, had to watch a few Youtube Tutorials.
  * String input in Rust is more complicated than I imagined.

  ### Things I learned:
  
  * Learnt about RegEx and its application in String validation.
  * Learnt a thing or two about Rust-lang.
***
## Task 8:
  
  ### Hurdles Faced:
  
  * Didn't know where to start.
  * had no idea on how to evaluate string math expressions in Python.
  
  ### Things I learned:
  
  * Stumbled upon the Tesseract OCR engine.
  * Learnt about the eval() function which evaluates math expressions.
***
## Task 9
  
  ### Hurdles Faced:
  
  * Had to learn HTML from scratch.
  * Inserting links and images was a pain for me.
  
  ### Things I learned:
  
  * Web is not my cup of tea (at least for the time being).
  * I discovered this amazing website called w3chools which basically got me through the whole task.
***

## Task 11:
  
  ### Hurdles Faced:
  
  * Had zero knowledge about detecting key-press in HTML.
  * Speeding up the ball as the game progressed.
  
  ### Things I learned:
  
  * Learnt about KeyboardEvents and Keycodes.
  * Learnt bits of HTML on the way.
***

## Task 12:
  
  ### Hurdles Faced:
  
  * The code was in Python2, converting it to Python3 was a pain.
  * Figuring out the xor() function took time.
  * I made reverse functions, but I was using them in the wrong order.
  
  ### Things I learned:
  
  * Learnt about the XOR gate.
  * Discovered that the xor() and the unxor() function are same, example => string = xor(xor(string)).
  * Learnt about hex(), ord() function.
  * Reversing is fun.
  
***

## Task 13:
  
  ### Hurdles Faced:
  
  * Handling the corner cases were a bit tricky.
  * Time limit was a big factor.
  * The test cases were hidden, which further increased the difficulty.
  
  ### Things I learned:
  
  * Found an interesting pattern, which aided the performance in the last problem.
  * Project Euler forced me to optimse code (avoid dots, avoid unnecessary for loops) for performance, which I rarely       do.
  
***


## Task 14:
  
  ### Hurdles Faced:
  
  * Didn't know some of the Linux Commands.
  * Didn't Know what SSH was, had to google everything.
  
  ### Things I learned:
  
  * Learnt Linux commands which were previously alien to me.
